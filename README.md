RPG game

I used a pretty inelegant solution to design the User Interface.  I set it up to just show and hide the cards as we switched between the different transformers.  I took the harder assignment, because I knew that I needed to work on my css/html/bootstrap skills.  It took a majority of my effort and I ran out of time to work on the fighting logic.

I have finished several stages...

Render the page with a relevent background, headers and individual cards for each robot with name and health information.

Select the users robot, the opponents robot and set aside the others for later battles.

Initiate the combat, do damage to the other player and kill them.

Things that are broken...

The opponent robot dissappears when the fight starts.  The health infomation does not update.

Selecting opponents after one has died doesnt work well.

I am confident that I could resolve the game logic bugs.  I took the harder assignement because I knew that I needed to work on the UI more than javascript.
